Camouflaged propaganda: A survey experiment on political native advertising ,2020,"We examine a new form of propaganda, political native advertising, in which political actors, including foreign governments, buy space in independent media outlets to publish advertisements that are camouflaged as standard news stories. Those who engage in this form of propaganda hope to exploit the higher credibility of the hosting media site to enhance the persuasiveness of their message. Despite the obvious political implications and ethical issues at stake, political native advertising has received almost no scholarly attention. Our article begins to redress this imbalance. Using an online survey experiment with real political native advertisements in the Washington Post and The Telegraph bought by the Chinese government, we provide some of the first empirical evidence on basic but important features of political native advertising. We find, among other things, that respondents struggle to distinguish political advertisements from standard news stories regardless of their level of education and media literacy, that political advertisements are more convincing if they appear on and are perceived as news from an independent hosting media site than in a government-controlled news outlet, and that trust in the hosting media site declines if the political advertisement is detected.",0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,,,

Exploring readers’ evaluations of native advertisements in a mobile news app ,2019,"Mobile news consumption is rising quickly, just as the appearance of native advertisements on mobile news platforms, yet little is known about readers’ mobile native advertising recognition and perceptions. This qualitative study, therefore, explores how readers recognise and perceive in-feed native advertisements in a mobile news app. Usability tests combined with interviews with 24 users of a national news app showed that in the mobile environment, readers are generally able to recognise native advertisements. The findings suggest four key factors that influence readers’ evaluations: (1) perceived utility, (2) source credibility of the advertiser, (3) perceived control, and (4) recognisability. The results suggest that besides readers’ advertising recognition, the advertisements’ content and context play an important role in explaining readers’ perceptions of native advertising.",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,

Is That My Friend or an Advert? The Effectiveness of Instagram Native Advertisements Posing as Social Posts ,2019,"Advertisers have turned attention to the popular photograph-based social network Instagram. One technique for reaching consumers has been advertisements resembling posts one’s friends might make. These native advertisements use Instagram’s conventions and may be unrecognized as sponsored messages at first glance, when browsing one’s Instagram. A within-subjects experiment (N = 482) tested these native ads against both user-generated posts and traditional advertisements. These message types were presented in a repeated-measures design, rotated across three well-known brands, and interspersed with distractor posts. Results indicated that the three message types produced similar effects on ad attitude, brand attitude, and behavioral intention. However, user-generated social posts produced more credibility and social comparison than native ads, and native ads produced more credibility and social comparison than advertisements. This yielded indirect effects on dependent variables of interest, despite the lack of total effects. Sponsorship recognition was relatively high for native ads but did not mediate effects.",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,

Selling their souls to the advertisers? How native advertising degrades the quality of prestige media outlets ,2019,"Native advertising – disguising sponsored content as journalistic material – is not a new phenomenon, but only recently has it reached news media outlets that stand for high-quality journalism. To investigate the potential impact of native advertising on perceived media quality, a 2 (source: low vs. high quality media outlet) _ 3 (content: ad-free article vs. declared native advertising article vs. undeclared native advertising article) factorial between-subjects experiment was conducted. This experimental study found that news media outlets that stand for high-quality journalism damage their quality as perceived by recipients when publishing properly declared native advertising.",0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,,,

Native Advertising: Is Deception an Asset or a Liability? ,2018,"Native advertising is among the most ethically charged strategies of digital communications. The ethical controversies are inherent in native advertising’s definition—paid advertising that is disguised to make readers think it is editorial content of digital publishers. Drawing on moral philosophy, the persuasion knowledge model, the social responsibility of the press theory, schema theory, and psychological reactance theory, this project demonstrated that consumers’ perceptions of native advertising’s deceptiveness increased advertising skepticism, irritation, and avoidance. In contrast, higher media trust resulted in lower perceived deceptiveness, skepticism, irritation, and avoidance. Thus, advertisers and online publishers will benefit from explicit disclosure of sponsorship that is responsible and transparent.",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,,,

"A Tale of Two Sources in Native Advertising: Examining the Effects of Source Credibility and Priming on Content,Organizations, and Media Evaluations ",2016,"In the strategic communication field, native advertising has been hailed as the next big trend. However, this type of marketing technique may negatively affect the perceptions of brands as well as media outlets that provide such content due to its obscurity of persuasive intent and ambiguity of the content source. The current study examined these issues by conducting a 2 (priming: presence vs. absence) _ 2 (media credibility: high vs. low) _ 2 (corporate credibility: high vs. low) factorial between-subjects experiment. A total of 500 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk completed the online experiment. Findings suggested that priming of native advertising information would significantly improve users’ ad recognition and change their content perception. In addition, a series of three-way interaction effects suggested that the interaction between the two types of source credibility (media and corporate) tend to work as a function of priming of native advertising information, which could completely change individuals’ perception of the ad content and evaluation of the media source in the future, but not their future corporate evaluation. Important theoretical as well as practical implications have also been discussed in this article.",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,,,

Predicting Pre-click Quality for Native Advertisements ,2016,"Native advertising is a specific form of online advertising where ads replicate the look-and-feel of their serving platform. In such context, providing a good user experience with the served ads is crucial to ensure long-term user engagement. In this work, we explore the notion of ad quality, namely the effectiveness of advertising from a user experience perspective. We design a learning framework to predict the pre-click quality of native ads. More specifically, we look at detecting offensive native ads, showing that, to quantify ad quality, ad offensive user feedback rates are more reliable than the commonly used click-through rate metrics. We then conduct a crowd-sourcing study to identify which criteria drive user preferences in native advertising. We translate these criteria into a set of ad quality features that we extract from the ad text, image and advertiser, and then use them to train a model able to identify offensive ads. We show that our model is very effective in detecting offensive ads, and provide in-depth insights on how different features affect ad quality. Finally, we deploy a preliminary version of such model and show its effectiveness in the reduction of the offensive ad feedback rate.",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,,,

The Deceptiveness of Sponsored News Articles: How Readers Recognize and Perceive Native Advertising ,2016,"Sponsored news is a form of native advertising that has engendered much hope as a solution for digital publishing revenue woes, but also much concern about whether the average consumer can discern its advertising nature. Recent U.S. federal guidelines and industry recommendations preach clear and conspicuous labeling of sponsored news articles, but little is known about how individual readers interpret these labels, and how their interpretation shapes their understanding of article content. The present study contributes knowledge to the former areas by presenting the results of a between-subjects experiment (N = 343) that tested the effects of four disclosure characteristics (proximity, visual prominence, wording clarity, and logo presence) on recognition of the sponsored content as advertising, and by analyzing the psychological process through which such recognition influences perceptions of the article and the sponsor. The results show that while logo presence and visual prominence increase the odds of recognition, logo presence also increases misperception of the disclosure label as a stand-alone display advertisement. Recognition of the article as advertising led to decreased perceptions of article quality, attitude toward the sponsor, and intent to share the article. A serial mediation analysis shows that the effects of recognition on attitudes and intent to share are primarily mediated through conceptual persuasion knowledge activation and perceived deceptiveness of the article. Implications of these findings for practitioners and for the application of persuasion theories to covert advertising are discussed.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,,,

Native Advertising and the Future of Mass Communication ,2016,"Native advertising, defined as the practice by which a marketer borrows from the credibility of a content publisher by presenting paid content with a format and location that matches the publisher’s original content, has been the primary driving engine of the Internet marketing economy for several years. Spending on native advertising is projected to grow from $4.7 billion in 2013 to $21 billion by 2018 (Hoelzel, 2015), and advertising agencies are not only using native broadly but also hoping to increase their usage (Aldridge, 2016). While a majority of online marketing seeks to narrowly target users based on topic, through the use publication audience data, user tracking, collaborative filtering, and other techniques, native advertising not only gives users content that matches the topic of the publishers’ original content but also does so by copying the format of nonpaid content. Native advertising can take a wide variety of forms, ranging from sponsored posts on social media platforms, sponsored articles and videos on sites that publish original content, and sponsored links and recommendation blocks on content providers and Web search engines.",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,,,

Native Advertising as a New Public Relations Tactic ,2016,"Using a pretest and posttest online experiment (N = 105), this study empirically explored the impact of native advertising sponsorship disclosure on organization–public relationships (OPR), credibility, brand attitude, and attitude toward the advertisement. Credibility and brand attitude predicted the two OPR factors; however, OPR was not affected by participants’ cognizance of ad sponsorship/disclosure. Brand attitude for obviously sponsored (e.g., ad disclosed) content decreased slightly. However, the presence or absence of sponsorship did not significantly influence either credibility or attitudes toward the advertisement itself. The study also examined perceived information utility.",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,

Native Advertising Is the New Journalism: How Deception Affects Social Responsibility ,2016,"Native advertising’s effectiveness lies in its ability to look like content produced by journalists. The potential for deceiving readers and proliferation of native advertising threaten journalism’s credibility along with its core boundary: the separation between editorial and advertising. For the press to function in a normative manner, as a watchdog, contributing to the public’s ability to self-govern, it simply cannot participate in deception. Therefore, 56 qualitative interviews were conducted with journalists, advertising, and public relations executives to examine the extent to which native advertising impedes on the social responsibility of the press. Perspectives revealed that all three professions agreed native advertising raises ethical concerns. Native advertising potentially deceives audiences who are unaware that native advertising is paid, persuasive content versus editorial, thus contributing to the diminishing credibility of journalism. Furthermore, if native advertising is done well, it is undetectable from traditional editorial content. Based on these findings, authors discuss how native advertising threatens several tenets of social responsibility theory.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,,,

Ethical Challenges of Hybrid Editors ,2016,"In times of turbulence in the media industry, media organizations are looking for new business models. Digitalization has led traditional news media organizations to testing new forms of advertisement, such as sponsored content and native advertising, whereas others, such as lifestyle magazines, have a longer history in collaborating with brands. Editors are key players in these developments, since they are journalist–managers and decision makers within those daily practices that shape policies and influence new product innovation and development. In this study, we examine from the editors’ point of view, how they see the process of adopting novel forms of advertisement and what ethical challenges are in the way. Building on interview data of lifestyle magazine editors and news editors in Finland (N=18), we present a study that identifies four editorial dilemmas arising from the intersection of brand collaboration and journalistic work in lifestyle magazines and provide a timely first look into an emerging new category of “hybrid editors” in newsrooms. Our results suggests that, in overall, editors’ attitudes toward new forms of brand collaboration are positive.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,

A Double-Edged Sword? Predicting Consumers’ Attitudes Toward and Sharing Intention of Native Advertising on Social Media ,2016,"Despite the increasing popularity and advantage of native advertising on social media, advertisers are concerned about the possibility of native ads misleading consumers, resulting in boomerang effects. This study attempts to address this concern by comparing the predictive role of native ad non-intrusiveness with that of native ad manipulativeness in consumers’ attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising. Findings from an online survey of 550 U.S. adult consumers showed that native ad non-intrusiveness was positively related to attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising, whereas native ad manipulativeness was not. Consumers’ ad skepticism and persuasion knowledge were negatively related to attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising; but persuasion knowledge became nonsignificant when native ad nonintrusiveness and manipulativeness were included in regression models. Additionally, those with stronger information-seeking motivation showed more positive attitudinal and behavioral responses. This study advances the knowledge of native advertising by examining the possibility of its being a double-edged sword. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,,,

Going Native: Can Consumers Recognize Native Advertising? Does It Matter?,2016,"Native advertising, which matches the look and feel of unpaid news and editorials, has exploded online. The Federal Trade Commission has long required advertising to be clearly and conspicuously labeled, and it recently reiterated that these requirements apply to native advertising. We explore whether respondents can distinguish native advertising and “regular” ads from unpaid content, using 16 native ads, 5 “regular” ads, and 8 examples of news/editorial content, drawn from multiple sources and platforms. Overall, only 37% of respondents thought that the tested examples of native advertising were paid content, compared to 81% for “regular” advertising, with variation by platform, advertiser, and labeling. Modest labeling changes materially increased the number of respondents that correctly recognized that native ads are paid content – but even these improved results fell well short of those for “regular” advertising. We also explored labeling preferences and self-reported concern about native advertising. Our findings indicate that native advertising involves a significant risk of deception which self-regulation has not addressed.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,,,

Playing hide-and-seek? A legal perspective on the complex distinction between commercial and editorial content in hybrid advertising formats ,2015,"Purpose – This paper aims to examine the challenges raised by hybrid advertising strategies for principles of identification and separation, included in various regulatory instruments, and the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD) in particular. 

Design/methodology/approach – First, this paper describes two examples of hybrid (television) advertising formats, with a potential interconnection between editorial and commercial content, such as advertorials and commercial overlays. This section is followed by an analysis of the origins and key elements of the identification and separation principle. Next, the implementation in legislation of Belgium (Flanders region), The Netherlands and the UK, and decisions of media regulators in those countries are explored to assess how the principles are interpreted in practice. Finally, the authors identify the concrete challenges that these formats raise and frame those against the background of European policy developments.

Findings – The analysis shows that the current interpretation of the identification and separation principles conflicts with the inherently integrated features of hybrid advertising formats, especially commercial overlays. To remedy this, the authors propose strengthening the identification principle, for instance, by developing cross-media labels and framing this within a co-regulatory framework where advertisers and media service providers take up their responsibility to respect fundamental principles and protect less cognitively skilled consumers, such as children. 

Originality/value – This paper aims to contribute to the current re-thinking of the legal framework with regard to new commercial communication techniques, convergence and public interest goals. This can be framed against the background of the revision of the AVMSD and the Digital Single Market Strategy. ",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,,,

Good native advertising isn’t a secret ,2015,"In this article, we develop an understanding of native advertising, a growing new form of online advertising, which we define as desired marketing communications that appear in-stream. Current forms of native advertising can be considered in terms of their secrecy: how aware a consumer is of a native advertisement’s source and intent. Based on existing research, we argue that less secretive native advertising will be more successful in the long run, and illustrate this using several cases. Finally, we detail important considerations for those marketers looking to capitalize on native advertising.",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,

Why and How to Regulate Native Advertising in Online News Publications,2015,"Native advertisements online are the latest incarnation of the long-running practice of blurring the lines between paid advertisement and independently created publisher content. This practice benefits advertisers by allowing them to leach credibility from news publications in exchange for payment. However, readers, as both consumers and citizens, lose out in this deal. Readers find it harder to accurately assess product claims and lose faith in the media as a vehicle for democratic discourse.
The U.S. government has played an important role in limiting this practice in the past, and it can do so again. It can use the current powers of the Federal Trade Commission more aggressively to regulate commercial native advertising and it can resurrect neglected FTC powers. Native ads deemed noncommercial, however, pose a tougher challenge. Even though these ads pose severe harms to citizens, the FTC cannot regulate them under the current commercial speech doctrine. Part I of this paper defines native ads in the online news context, explains why they are uniquely harmful, and makes the case for government regulation. Part II examines how the government can protect consumers from the harms of native ads using FTC precedent, and then explains why the government has limited ability to protect citizens from such harms. Finally, the paper looks at potential government action beyond the FTC.",1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,,,

Persuasion and the Online Consumers: Investigating Copywriting Strategies in Native Advertisements ,2014,"This study aims at analysing the copywriting strategies of slimming product advertisements in determining consumers’ information seeking action. The study was conducted qualitatively via a focus group. Women who actively seek for slimming products in Facebook were selected through the purposive sampling technique. The findings indicated that most of the informants were attracted to read the body copy of the advertisements because of the unique headlines as well as the use of striking, contrasting colours for fonts and the background. Testimonials, the word ‘repeat order’ and language usage on the other hand were elements that enhanced the informants’ interest towards the native advertisements. Most importantly, the desire to own the advertised products came after the informants saw the believable comparative pictures and weight reduced text which then stimulates them to click on the advertisements’ Facebook pages to look for more details about the products. Nevertheless, some of the informants ignored some of the advertisements shown to them because they doubted the product’s unique selling proposition (USP). Provocation statements in the advertisements, on the other hand were perceived as unfavourable among the informants, thus led them not to click on its’ Facebook page.",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,,,

Native Advertising and its Effects on Online Advertising,2014,"According to Financial Times Limited (2013), the digital revolution has made many business models obsolete and advertising companies see this as a welcome change. Online social networking and internal structural changes in the media market have changed how online advertising is done. This change has many concurrent forms and implications, and the most apparent of them might be the change in the various strategies and tactics companies are adapting in response to said changes; mainly advertising online in the form of native advertising; while one company is inhibiting media profitability in its current form, at the same time furthering the its corporate sponsors’ agenda to promote and implement native advertising- or “non-intrusive” advertising- as the norm of online advertising.",0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,,,

‘Advertorials’: A genre-based analysis of an emerging hybridized genre ,2012,"Genre analysis has been applied to a sizable body of linguistic studies on various text types. However, little attention has been paid to advertorials as an emerging hybridized genre. To identify the generic and linguistic characteristics of advertorials, and therefore to classify advertorials into an appropriate genre, this study carries out a comprehensive genre analysis of advertorials based on Bhatia’s (1993) seven-step genre analysis methodology. A corpus of 55 advertorials was collected from four English-language magazines and two English-language newspapers, from which a sub-corpus of 12 samples was further selected for a thorough examination of linguistic characteristics. Attempting to gain a comprehensive view of generic features of advertorials, this study makes a critical comparison of advertorials with three inextricably related genres: advertisements, news stories and editorials. Linguistic evidence sufficiently demonstrates that advertorials share fundamental generic and linguistic natures with advertisements and proposes classifying advertorials as a sub-genre of advertisements.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,,,
