Making (Branded) News: The Corporate Co-optation of Online Journalism Production ,2020,"As traditional news outlets decline and corporations cultivate publisher ambitions, brand journalism (i.e., native advertising and content marketing) has grown robustly. This paper examines and critiques the various ways in which those corporations have adopted and mirror news production practices, given the “technologics” of convergence culture and the political economy pressures of our media era. The research draws upon 28 in-depth interviews with brand journalism professionals who operate in the United States along with years of trade press coverage of the phenomenon. Findings illustrate how brand journalism is informed by traditional reporting fundamentals and techniques, the affordances and demands of online environments, and industrial shifts in media labor allocation.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,,

"How news went guerrilla marketing: a history, logic, and critique of brand journalism",2020,"For decades, product placement and branded content have invaded more entertainment-oriented media forms; today, the rise of brand journalism (i.e. native advertising and content marketing) suggests that advertisers are now targeting news as a genre for commercial schemes. This article examines that practice through a critical analysis of advertising industry discourse including 28 in-depth interviews with brand journalism practitioners in the United States along with a decade of trade press coverage. It sketches the first historical trajectory of brand journalism and contextualizes the media industry factors that motivate participants’ exploration of it as a promotional vehicle. Drawing upon guerrilla marketing theory, this article further documents how brand journalism evinces a fundamental commercial self-effacement at its core – in mimicking journalistic style and substance – and thus portends a redefinition of advertising as a visible mass communication form.",0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,,

“It’s Complicated”: Cognitive Dissonance and the Evolving Relationship Between Editorial and Advertising in US Newsrooms ,2020,"Editorial and commercial functions in news organizations operate under conflicting values which dictate their separation lest commercial interests influence editorial decision-making. Yet this historic partition is challenged by the deterioration of the old advertiser-sponsored business model. The relationship is growing closer, at the risk of causing psychological discomfort to those involved. This study assesses what happens when senior editors encounter cognitive dissonance as they reconstruct the editorial-commercial relationship. It finds reluctance to embrace this evolving relationship, revealed in the fragmented and contradictory syntax editors use to talk about it as they are torn between the old (ethically driven) norm of how things should be, and the emerging (economically driven) norm of how things are. Yet, the paper suggests that cognitive dissonance may be the preferred state for any newsworker in an organization tasked with delivering news to a community which is not prepared to pay the full price for it, requiring some form of external subsidy. Rather than being dissonance that requires resolution, it becomes a vital, desirable tension whose perpetuation gives value to work.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,,

‘We no longer live in a time of separation’: A comparative analysis of how editorial and commercial integration became a norm ,2020,"The separation between editorial and business activities of news organisations has long been a fundamental norm of journalism. Journalists have traditionally considered this separation as both an ethical principle and an organisational solution to preserve their professional autonomy and isolate their newsrooms from profit-driven pressures exerted by advertising, sales and marketing departments. However, many news organisations are increasingly integrating their editorial and commercial operations. Based on 41 interviews conducted at 12 newspapers and commercial broadcasters in six European countries, we analyse how editors and business managers describe the changing relationship between their departments. Drawing on previous research on journalistic norms and change, we focus on how interviewees use rhetorical discourses and normative statements to de-construct traditional norms, build new professionally accepted norms and legitimise new working practices. We find, first, that the traditional norm of separation no longer plays the central role that it used to. Both editors and managers are working to foster a cultural change that is seen as a prerequisite for organisational adaptation to an increasingly challenging environment. Second, we find that a new norm of integration, based on the values of collaboration, adaptation and business thinking, has emerged. Third, we show how the interplay between declining and emerging norms involves a difficult negotiation. Whereas those committed to the traditional norm see commercial considerations as a threat to professional autonomy, our interviewees see the emerging norm as a new way of ensuring professional autonomy by working with other parts of the organisation to jointly ensure commercial sustainability.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,,

Camouflaging Church as State: An exploratory study of journalism’s native advertising,2020,"This paper explores the increasing trend of adopting native advertising in the digital editions of traditional news media outlets. Native advertising is defined here as a form of paid media where the commercial content is delivered within the design and form of editorial content, as an attempt to recreate the user experience of reading news instead of advertising content. Methodologically, this study examines 12 news websites of legacy newspapers from Sweden, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and analyzes the adoption of native advertising during the span of January 2015. Subsequently, these advertisements are analyzed in terms of type, form, function, integration, measurement, disclosure, and authorship. The results show that while the degree of implementation is still modest, the way in which it is implemented is uneven across countries.",0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,,

Advertising in disguise? How disclosure and content features influence the effects of native advertising ,2020,"Native advertising has recently become a prominent buzzword for advertisers and publishers alike. It describes advertising formats which closely adapt their form and style to the editorial environment they appear in, intending to hide the commercial character of these ads. In two experimental studies, we test how advertising disclosures in native ads on news websites affect recipients’ attitudes towards a promoted brand in a short and long-term perspective. In addition, we explore persuasion through certain content features (i. e., message sidedness and use of exemplars) and how they affect disclosure effects. Results show that disclosures increase perceived persuasive intent but do not necessarily decrease brand attitudes. However, disclosure effects do not persist over time and remain unaffected by content features. ",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,"""affect recipients' attitudes"" ",

News in an Era of Content Confusion: Effects of News Use Motivations and Context on Native Advertising and Digital News Perceptions,2020,"This study examined the effects of news use motivations and differing native advertising contexts (hard vs. soft news) on the ability to perceive commercialized content, evaluations of native advertising, and ensuing digital news perceptions. Based upon the framework of the persuasion knowledge model, an online experiment was conducted among a sample of U.S. adults (N = 684). Engaging with news for informational motivations conditioned perceptions of advertising as did the contextual effects of hard versus soft news. Furthermore, hard-news approaches to native advertising were perceived more unfavorably by audiences and tarnished the subsequent reporting of actual journalists.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,"""ability to perceive coommercialized content"" - PCD

The other ‘fake’ news: Professional ideals and objectivity ambitions in brand journalism,2019,"The recent ascendance of brand journalism – whereby corporations employ news-like labor and means to court consumers and cultivate consciousness – raises serious concerns about the church–state boundary, as well as other long-standing press ideals such as objectivity and social responsibility. This article examines the fate of those practices and ambitions, as articulated by the professionals involved in the production of this quasi-reportorial, quasi-advertising content. The method of inquiry relies upon 28 in-depth interviews with those who manage and work in native advertising and content marketing in the United States, as well as extensive trade press coverage of the phenomenon, to understand the principles they profess and the adaptations they have undergone in transitioning from traditional editorial to now more commercial employment. It concludes with a political economy critique of what these corporate aspirations might cost the information credibility and democratic potential of the news genre.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,,

The Role Performance of Native Advertising in Legacy and Digital-Only News Media ,2019,"This study compares the role performance of native advertising on the websites of legacy news media and digital-only news media in the United States. Instead of analyzing discourses and rhetorics about native advertising, this study concentrates on the content characteristics of native advertising to infer its roles oriented to audiences. The study finds that native ads on the selected media sites have more emphasis on the service role than the civic and infortainment roles. The digital-only media sites have native ads with more emphasis on the service and infortainment roles than those in the legacy media sites, whereas the legacy media sites have native ads with more emphasis on the civic role than its counterparts in the digital-only media sites. However, native advertising lacks independent and transparent sources of information. Nearly half of the native ads on the legacy media sites reply on sponsor-affiliated sources, and more than half of the native ads on the digital-only media sites lack attributions for sources of information.",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,,

Contest Over Authority: Navigating native advertising’s impacts on journalism autonomy,2019,"This study explores how editors and business executives discursively renegotiated the boundary of authority in the wave of integrating native advertising at nine US publishers across five years. The findings demonstrate an overwhelmingly pro-business voice that legitimized native advertising as an innovation to increase revenue, advertisers’ interest, audience engagement, and even editorial quality. By contrast, the pro-editorial voice that resisted the integration inside the organizations was scattered and muted and gradually turned into a collaboration with the business side, while the industrial debate remained critical and unsettled on editorial involvement in content marketing. The dilution of the editorial–business boundary in those organizations suggests that journalistic autonomy was lessened from within—the autonomous force of journalism submitted authority to the heteronomous force of journalism.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,,

Brand disclosure and source partiality affect native advertising recognition and media credibility ,2019,This study explores how textual characteristics of native advertising affected audiences’ advertising recognition and perceived message credibility and media channel credibility. Findings show that repeated mentioning of brand names increased audiences’ advertising recognition but did not affect perceived message credibility or media credibility. Using sponsor-affiliated sources increased audiences’ advertising recognition but decreased perceived message credibility and media credibility. The study recommends frequent and early sponsorship disclosure and cautions against using sponsor-affiliated sources in native advertising.,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,,

Interplay of content type and product type in the consumer response to native advertising on social media ,2019,"With the growth of consumer skepticism toward advertising, marketers have begun implementing native advertising. Drawing on the Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM), this study examines how content type interacts with product type to influence consumer responses toward native advertising (persuasion knowledge, brand attitude, and intention to click ‘like’) on Facebook. A 2(content type: informative versus entertaining) _ 2 (product type: utilitarian versus hedonic) between-subjects experimental study was conducted with a total of 155 college-attending Facebook users in South Korea. The results show that, for utilitarian products, informative content elicits more favorable consumer responses than entertaining content does. However, consumer responses are similar between informative and entertaining content for hedonic products. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that consumer persuasion knowledge mediates the interaction effects of content type and product type on consumer responses. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,,

When politicians go native: The consequences of political native advertising for citizens’ trust in news ,2019,"Declining revenues from offline and online ads has led publishers to pursue new avenues, such as native advertising: camouflaging ads as news. Critics of native advertising claim that this form of advertising blurs the boundaries between editorial and commercial content, and can reduce the audiences’ trust in editorial content. However, little research has assessed the possible effects of native ads on audiences’ trust in news. With an experimental design embedded in an online survey (N = 733) representative of the Norwegian population, this study explores the consequences of political native advertising for citizens’ trust in political news. This article discusses how political native advertising poses a challenge to the boundary between journalism and advertising as well as the boundary between journalism and powerful elites. Our study examines (1) how prominently native advertisements should be labelled in order for readers to recognize them as advertising content and (2) whether exposure to such ads reduces readers’ trust in political news. Our most important finding shows that when explicitly labelled, native advertising by political parties can reduce people’s trust in political news.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,,

Native advertising and the cultivation of counterfeit news ,2019,"It has long been an article of faith that while advertising subsidizes news and other editorial content, it stands alone in its appearance and appeal. As early as the late 1880s, years before the professionalization of journalism began to manifest itself in codes of ethics and other expressions of newsroom norms, Charles A. Dana, for nearly three decades, the prominent and influential owner and editor of the New York Sun, proffered his own eight ‘maxims or professional rules’, one of which made clear the importance of keeping news and advertising separate and distinct: ‘Never print a paid advertisement as news matter. Let every advertisement appear as an advertisement; no sailing under false colors’ (quoted by Dicken-Garcia, 1989: 220). ",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,,

Reducing Native Advertising Deception: Revisiting the Antecedents and Consequences of Persuasion Knowledge in Digital News Contexts ,2019,"Building on the persuasion knowledge model, this study examines how audience characteristics and native advertising recognition influence the covert persuasion process. Among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 738), we examined digital news readers’ recognition of a sponsored news article as advertising. Although fewer than 1 in 10 readers recognized the article as advertising, recognition was most likely among younger, more educated consumers who engaged with news media for informational purposes. Recognition led to greater counterarguing, and higher levels of informational motivation also led to less favorable evaluations of the content among recognizers. News consumers were most receptive to native advertising in a digital news context when publishers were more transparent about its commercial nature. Beyond theoretical insights into the covert persuasion process, this study offers practical utility to the advertisers, publishers, and policymakers who wish to better understand who is more likely to be confused by this type of advertising so that they can take steps to minimize deception.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,,

Political Advertising Camouflage as News ,2018,"Advanced technology has significantly influenced media and their environment, including their audience and advertisers. The changes have forced the media to rethink their business model. Native advertising, undisruptive advertising that looks like the original content of the media, is one of the new advertising forms developed in the past few years. This trend started in Indonesia in 2014 as some big online media offer the native advertising space to the advertisers. In the perspective of Baudrillard’s postmodern view, this is a kind of simulation which may lead to the death of the reality. This study seeks to find the way news simulation work in Indonesian online media advertising. The result shows that the packaging, the placement, and the minimum disclosure of political native advertising have blurred the separation between commercial and editorial content. Analyzing from Baudrillard’s perspective, this news simulation is at the second stage of simulation, or evil appearance, in which people can no longer differentiate between the real news and the advertising which simulate the news.

Journalism Hits a Wall: Rhetorical construction of newspapers’ editorial and advertising relationship,2018,This study analyzes how business and editorial staff members at US newspapers rhetorically construct or deconstruct the metaphoric norm of a wall or line of separation between news and advertising functions. The study is based on 18 in-depth interviews with news and advertising professionals at middle-market US newspapers and the subsequent analysis of their rhetoric about the relationship between the news and advertising sides of their organizations. The study seeks to understand the rhetorical construction of an institutional norm and our observations are focused on the organization level. This study aids understanding of two related phenomena: how institutional norms are rhetorically constructed and how norms are rhetorically renegotiated or deconstructed.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,,

Under the Influence: Advertisers’ Impact on the Content of Swiss Free Newspapers ,2017,"The study focuses on whether and to what extent advertisers influence the editorial content of free newspapers in the German part of Switzerland. The contribution analyzes, grounded on an historic approach, the most competitive period in Switzerland, 2008, when not less than five freesheets were competing for advertisers and public attention. By using Altmeppen’s (2006) organizational theory, the paper offers a theoretical frame able to describe the vanishing co-orientation between the media management and the newsroom, a trend that aggravates commercialization processes in news organizations. In a situation of economic turmoil, so the hypothesis, newsrooms are more inclined to positively adapt the valence of their coverage about their main advertisers in order to keep them in the portfolio. Using a content analysis, the author examined the editorial coverage of six among the most important advertisers of Swiss free newspapers, carrying out an aggregated statistical analysis based on logistic regression. The study revealed that free newspapers with a strong market orientation display a higher chance to publish positive facts and evaluations about advertisers with a high advertising expenditure.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,,

"The Future of Journalism: Risks, threats and opportunities",2016,"Today journalism, as an industry and a profession, is characterised by ever-increasing turbulence and change, for better and for worse. Profound transformations affect every aspect of the institution, including the economic health of journalism, the conditions and self-understandings of its practitioners, its ability to serve as a watchdog on concentrations of power, its engagement with and relationship to its audience, and its future prospects. This emerging and dynamic ecology can be viewed as a unique constellation of challenges and opportunities. For these reasons, the fifth Future of Journalism conference, held in Cardiff on 10–11 September 2015, focused on the theme of Risks, Threats and Opportunities. The conference saw over 120 papers from around the world presented across 34 sessions, with keynote speeches from Dan Gillmor, Stephen Reese and Jean Seaton.

The Business of Slow Journalism: Deep storytelling’s alternative economies,2016,"This study examines the commercial viability of Slow Journalism in light of its recent efforts to reinvent the business model in the news industry today that relies heavily or exclusively on display advertising for revenue. Some Slow Journalism companies, such as De Correspondent and Delayed Gratification, have defiantly positioned themselves in opposition to advertising’s prominent role in mitigating free online news production and consumption, which they argue is both philosophically and financially anathema to the intimate journalist–reader interface. Still others, such as Narratively, have also eliminated display advertisements, but openly embrace brand sponsorship through events, creative agency, and native advertising. Touting visually pleasing high-end production values for immersive reading environments free of distracting display advertisements, many publishers promote a relation in which supply meets demand without undisclosed, conflicting third-party or corporate interest. This research explores the methods by which several prominent Slow Journalism organizations have mobilized a critique of corporate media to strategically communicate their maverick missions. The case studies examine Delayed Gratification, De Correspondent, Narratively, and The Big Roundtable as expressions of Slow Journalism’s experimental approaches to for-profit enterprise through alternative media business models.",0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,,

"Journalism embracing advertising as traditional journalism discourse becomes marginal: A comparative study of European MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events) magazines",2012,"The border between journalism and marketing communication is diminishing and media such as television and magazines are especially vulnerable to the colonisation of traditional journalistic genres by promotional information. From the point of view of audience perception, grouping certain media channels or discourses into ‘‘journalistic’’ and others into ‘‘promotional’’ or ‘‘mixed’’ would provide a certain level of predictability, as well as a basis for their judgement of information. However, we argue here that category confusion takes place even inside sub-sectors of niche magazines. The objective of this international comparative research is to analyse the editorial ideologies and discursive practices concerning the hybridisation of media discourse in one media sector: the Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Events (MICE) sub-sector of niche magazines.

"Journalists and the information- attention markets: 
Towards an economic theory of journalism",2008,"In this article we suggest economic theory (specifically rational choice theory) as a promising approach to analyze the dramatic changes journalism is currently going through. Referring to the model of the ‘homo economicus maturus’ as well as to previous research by a small but growing number of scholars of mass communication, we describe journalists as rational actors seeking to maximize materialistic and non-materialistic rewards (e.g. attention, reputation, fringe benefits). We explain why, how and under what kind of restrictions journalists trade information for attention with their sources, calculating risks and benefits. Further, we apply economic concepts (free-riding, external effects, and principal-agent theory) to journalism to provide more in-depth explanations for specific developments in journalism such as ‘pack reporting’. We conclude that assuming self-interested behaviour of media professionals will enable scholars of journalism to identify and predict more systematically the failures of journalism and blind spots of media coverage.",0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,,

Commercial News Criteria and Investigative Journalism,2006,"Since the 1980s, the commercialisation of the media in Norway has prompted two opposing theories concerning the impact of commercial news criteria; the first suggests it restrains, the second that it stimulates, investigative journalism. But the two theories draw the same normative conclusion, namely that commercialisation has negative implications for the contribution of media to democracy. This article presents the two theories, and puts their empirical assumptions to the test, using the distribution of awards for outstanding investigative journalism as a yardstick. The test results are discussed in the light of economic theory. It seems that critics of media commercialisation have placed too much emphasis on the cost-cutting aspect of a capitalist economy, and too little on capitalism as ‘‘the free-market innovation machine’’. The conclusion is that commercial news criteria stimulate investigative journalism more than they restrain it, and that investigative journalism’s contribution to democracy is more positive than negative.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,,

Beyond advertising and journalism: hybrid promotional news discourse ,2004,"The aim of this article is to show the usefulness of an expanded version of Fairclough’s Critical Discourse Analysis approach, i.e. an approach that combines text analysis with an analysis of discourse processes in studying text production and interpretation, and also incorporates ethnographic methods, in this case, participant observation and interviews. This expanded approach was checked in the study of illegal promotional news discourse; the study was conducted chronologically in two stages. In the first stage, an analysis of interpractice – which identifies cases in which specific other practices of the process of text production and interpretation are overtly drawn upon within a practice – was used to identify promotional news reports and uncover elements of promotional practice which are drawn upon within journalism, such as having the advertiser, who realizes his/her commercial interest by paying for publishing or killing a certain story, as the key actor in the process of promotional news production. In the second stage, analysis of interdiscursivity revealed how promotional journalism through textual devices (genre, topics, perspective, choice of sources, lexical choice, over-lexicalization, coherence, choice of processes and participants) incorporates discursive elements of promotion which are drawn upon within the news report discourse, such as using representatives of the organization as almost the only participants, partiality, positive-only evaluation of the characteristics/activities of the subject discussed, which is in the interest of those discussed by the texts and not the readers.",0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,,

On the Deceptive Effectiveness of Labeled and Unlabeled Advertorial Formats ,2001,"This experiment investigates the effects of an advertorial message on 4 dimensions of reader involvement. The use of the advertorial format was found to have increased participants’ perceived message relevance, attention to written message, message elaboration, and message recall over the use of a standard advertisement format. Responses to labeled and unlabeled versions of the same advertorial did not vary significantly. Although participants perceived both labeled and unlabeled advertorials to be advertisements, rather than editorial material, more than two thirds of the participants who were exposed to a labeled advertorial failed to recall the presence of the label.
