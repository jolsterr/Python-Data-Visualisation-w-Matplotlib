"Native Advertising Credibility Perceptions and Ethical Attitudes: An exploratory study among adolescents in the United States, Turkey and Israel",2020,"The current exploratory research aims to understand adolescent perceptions of credibility and ethical attitudes toward online native advertising (NA), in conjunction with persuasion knowledge, and explore how these attitudes might differ in three different cultures: U.S., Turkey and Israel. A survey employing a NA article was administered among adolescents (n = 610). The manipulation examined their ethical attitudes and credibility perceptions toward the NA articles before and after the persuasion knowledge. Findings strengthen research assumptions that most adolescents have encountered NA without recognizing it as persuasive communication. Adolescents find NA articles less credible and less ethical when they are informed about it. Moreover, results show that adolescents in general have a tendency to accept NA as a moral practice, while findings point to significant differences in responses moderated by country of origin.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,"""adolescent perceptions"" - PP2

The Covert Advertising Recognition and Effects (CARE) model: Processes of persuasion in native advertising and other masked formats,2020,"Covert advertisements, or those that utilize the guise and delivery mechanisms of familiar non-advertising formats, differ from other more direct forms of advertising in several ways that are important for understanding users’ psychological responses. Research across various covert advertising formats including various forms of sponsored editorial content, other native advertising formats, and product placement has shown that variation consumers’ persuasive responses to such messages is largely driven by whether they recognize that such messages are advertising at all. After reviewing the findings of empirical research into covert advertising effects, we present a model of covert advertising recognition effects (CARE) that outlines potential antecedents and processes underlying the recognition of covert advertising, and maps several pathways to persuasive outcomes that are contingent on advertising recognition and perceptions related to the information in and perceived presentation of the advertisement itself.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,"""understanding users’ psychological responses"" ; ""persuasive responses"" - PP2

Examining Consumers’ Recognition of Native and Banner Advertising on News Website Home Pages ,2020,"Native advertising has grown tremendously as consumers have shifted attention from traditional to digital media. Using an eye-tracking method and a general population sample, an online survey examined whether consumers could recognize native ads and banner ads on digital news website home pages with similar speed and effectiveness. It also investigated the relationship between ad skepticism and recognition of native and banner advertising. Results suggest that native ads are more discoverable, or more quickly noticed, than banner ads. However, only 68% of participants could recognize at least one native ad, and those who did took significantly longer to recognize native than banner units as ads. Even among consumers with high skepticism toward advertising, who should have richer knowledge about the strategies and tactics of advertisers, no relationship was found between ad skepticism and native ad recognition.",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,"""ads are more discoverable & quickly noticed"" economic benefits vs banner ads - PFE

Activating persuasion knowledge in native advertising: the influence of cognitive load and disclosure language,2020,"Incorporating the theory of limited cognitive capacity and persuasion knowledge model, this article examines the interaction effect between cognitive load and disclosure language on the activation of persuasion knowledge and perceived manipulativeness of native advertising. Two experimental studies suggested that individuals with varied levels of cognitive load responded to native advertisements using explicit versus implicit disclosure language differently.

Sponsorship Disclosure and Consumer Deception: Experimental Evidence from Native Advertising in Mobile Search ,2020,"Recent advances in advertising technology have lead to the development of “native advertising,” which is a format of advertising that mimics the other nonsponsored content on the medium. Whereas advertisers have rapidly embraced the format on a variety of digital media, regulators have expressed serious concerns about whether this format materially deceives consumers because the advertising disclosure is incomplete or inappropriate. This has reignited a longstanding debate about the distinction between advertising and content in media markets, and how it affects consumers. This paper contributes to this debate by providing empirical evidence from a randomized experiment conducted on native advertising at a mobile restaurant search platform. We experimentally vary the format of paid-search advertising, the extent to which ads are disclosed to over 200,000 users, and track their anonymized browsing behavior including clicks and conversions. The research design we propose uses comparisons of revealed preferences under experimentally manipulated treatment and control conditions to assess the potential for consumer confusion and deception. A design based on revealed preference speaks to the “material” standard of regulators, helps assess confusion while avoiding directly questioning consumers, and may be useful in other settings. Implementing the design, we find that native advertising benefits advertisers and detect no evidence of deception under typically used formats of disclosure currently used in the paid-search marketplace. Further investigation shows that the incremental conversions due to advertising are not driven by users clicking on the native ads. Rather, the benefits from advertising are driven by users seeing the ads and later clicking on the advertiser’s “organic” listings. Thus, we find little support of native advertising tricking users into clicking and driving them to advertisers as typically feared; instead, users seem to view ads and deliberately evaluate the advertisers. Furthermore, mere exposure seems sufficient to produce most of the incremental effect of advertising.",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,"""decevives consumers""; ""tricking"" - PFV

Young adults’ recognition of native advertising disguised as news ,2020,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to test hypotheses on the effects of native advertising on young media consumers. First, it aims to discover whether the young audience activates news-based schema or advertising schema when exposed to different themes of native advertising. Second, this research tests whether there is a relationship between the theme of native advertising and the credibility of the media in which it is placed and the ability of young media consumers to recognize the advertising. Third, it attempts to seek a possible relationship between the recognition of native advertising and the credibility of the advertiser.


Design/methodology/approach – An experimental study was carried out using 186 university students in the greater Jakarta area whose ages ranged between 18 and 22 years. Participants were randomly assigned to six groups (2 - 3 experimental design) and asked to respond to a set of questions related to their awareness of native advertising. They were also asked their opinions on the advertiser’s credibility before and after they were told that the content was native advertising.

Findings – Results show that most of these young media consumers could not spot native advertising and have difficulties in recognizing political native advertising. The findings also point out a more profound decline in advertiser credibility among groups exposed to political native advertising compared to nonpolitical native advertising.

Research limitations/implications – Results show that most of these young media consumers could not spot native advertising and have difficulties in recognizing political native advertising. The findings also point out a more profound decline in advertiser credibility among groups exposed to political native advertising compared to non-political native advertising.

Originality/value – This research shows that the theme of the native advertising has a significant influence on the ability of media consumers to recognize native advertising. The results indicate that non-commercial native advertising is highly deceptive. This finding is valuable for the improvement of advertising regulation, especially on non-commercial native advertising.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,"""university students; young media consumers"" - PP2

Moving Towards Transparency for Native Advertisements on News Websites: A Test of More Detailed Disclosures ,2020,"As readers often do not recognize the commercial nature of native advertising on news websites, clear disclosures are required to prevent deception. The present study therefore tests whether and how providing disclosures with more detailed information about both the authorship of native ads and the importance of advertising revenue for news media’s business models can increase readers’ recognition and understanding of native advertising. Once readers are aware that they are viewing native advertising, the study assesses whether perceptions of transparency can positively influence readers’ evaluations of the credibility of native advertising, advertisers and news media in general. Results of the online experiment that tested four disclosure types show that, compared to using standard disclosures such as ‘partner content’ and ‘sponsored by [brand]’, providing more detailed disclosures leads to higher perceived sponsorship transparency, which in turn increases credibility of native advertising, advertisers and news media in general.",0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,"""clear disclosures are required to prevent deception"" - PCD

How advertising relevance and consumer – Brand relationship strength limit disclosure effects of native ads on Twitter ,2020,"Present research builds upon native advertising research by examining the roles of advertising message relevance, consumer-brand relationship strength, and authorship. Two national experiments were conducted among active Twitter users ages 18–34. In Study 1 (N = 147), a 2 (disclosure: tweet/promoted tweet) X 2 (high-/ low-ad message relevance) experiment showed that while disclosure had no effect on advertising outcomes, strong message relevance effects were present. Study 2 (N = 363), a 2 (weaker/ stronger brand relationship strength) X 2 (disclosure: tweet/promoted tweet) X 3 (authorship: brand/influencer/peer) design, found that consumer–brand relationship strength also directly and positively influences attitude towards the brand, purchase intention and sharing intention; while significantly enhancing the positive message relevance impact on sharing intention, relevance’s impact on purchase intention was lessened. Greater consumer–brand relationship strength influence on attitude towards the brand and purchase intention was present when native ads were authored by peers rather than brands or influencers ",0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,"""roles of advertising message, relevance, consumer-brand relationship strength & authorship"" - PFE

Fake Ads: The Influence of Counterfeit Native Ads on Brands and Consumers ,2020,"This research explores fake ads: social media posts created by influencers that are designed look like ads but are unpaid. An experiment finds that consumers’ perceptions of fake and real ads varies based on their social media experience. Influencers may also be seen as pushy, which reduces attitudes toward the brand featured in the post. Brands should monitor social media for fake ads featuring their brand so that these posts can be removed before they damage the brand’s reputation. This research is limited by its reliance on Facebook ads; social media platform could influence findings and invites future research. ",0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,"""damage the brand's reputation"" - PCC

Negative Consequences of Storytelling in Native Advertising ,2020,"Native advertising and storytelling are both increasingly popular advertising strategies. This research explores the effectiveness of storytelling in a native advertising context on social media. While most research recommends the use of stories as a way to build trust and relationships with consumers, the current research suggests that in the form of native ads on social media, narratives may be less effective when compared to informational native ads. Two studies find that even when advertising cues such as disclosure labels and brand presence are prominently located, consumers are less likely to recognize the advertising nature of narrative native ads when compared to informational native ads. Lower levels of advertising recognition are associated with increased perceptions of manipulative intentions by the advertiser, which has a negative influence on consumers' attitudes toward the ad. The findings suggest that native ads that clearly communicate their advertising nature through cues such as an informational execution, high brand presence, and prominent disclosure labeling are more effective than a narrative execution style.",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,"""prominent disclosure labelling, ad recognition"" - PCD

Unguarded against Persuasion and Willing to Share: The Combined Effect of Chronic Regulatory Focus and Disclosure Language on Consumer Responses to Native Advertising ,2020,"While disclosure has been largely investigated within existing native advertising research, consumers’ individual characteristics, which may influence the persuasion process, have not received sufficient academic attention in this area. Through online experiments, this research examined the interplay between chronic regulatory focus and disclosure language on consumer responses to native advertising across two studies. The results from Study 1 indicated that participants with a strong promotion focus were less cognizant of the commercial nature of the native ad when exposed to a native ad using an implicit disclosure label rather than one using an explicit disclosure label. More importantly, in Study 1, these participants expressed a stronger intention to share a native ad using an implicit disclosure label rather than one using an explicit disclosure label, whereas prevention-focused people reacted to native advertisements with an explicit label more positively than one using an implicit label. Study 2 further suggested that perceived persuasion intent could be the potential underlying mechanism that explained such an interaction effect. Theoretical and practical contributions of these findings are discussed.",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,"""consumer's individual characteristics, consumer responses"" - PP2

Predicting Consumer Avoidance of Native Advertising on Social Networking Sites: A Survey of Facebook Users ,2020,"As a result of constant efforts to improve consumers’ online advertising experiences, native advertising has started to gain popularity on social networking sites (SNSs). This survey study examined antecedents of avoidance of native advertising on SNSs and the moderating role of consumer skepticism toward native advertising. Our findings suggest perceived intrusiveness and perceived informative and entertainment advertising value as major antecedents of consumer advertising avoidance. Additionally, the number of brands that consumers are following on SNSs and negative communication among peers on SNSs were found to be factors affecting native advertising avoidance. Finally, consumer skepticism toward native advertising was found to be an important moderating variable in the mechanism of advertising avoidance on SNSs.

"Native Advertising in Online News: Trade-Offs Among Clicks, Brand Recognition, and Website Trustworthiness ",2020,"Native advertising is a type of online advertising that matches the form and function of the platform on which it appears. In practice, the choice between display and in-feed native advertising presents brand advertisers and online news publishers with conflicting objectives. Advertisers face a trade-off between ad clicks and brand recognition, whereas publishers need to strike a balance between ad clicks and the platform’s trustworthiness. For policy makers, concerns that native advertising confuses customers prompted the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to issue guidelines for disclosing native ads. This research aims to understand how consumers respond to native ads versus display ads and to different styles of native ad disclosures, using randomized online and field experiments combining behavioral clickstream, eye movement, and survey response data. The results show that when the position of an ad on a news page is controlled for, a native ad generates a higher click-through rate because it better resembles the surrounding editorial content. However, a display ad leads to more visual attention, brand recognition, and trustworthiness for the website than a native ad.

"In-Feed Native Advertising on News Websites: Effects of Advertising Format, Website Reputation, and Product Involvement ",2019,"Focusing on two popular types of native advertising, endemic in-feed advertisements and linked in-feed advertisements, the current study examined the effects of advertising format, website reputation, and product involvement on perceived advertising credibility (trustworthiness and expertise), attitude toward the advertisement, brand interest, and purchase intention. In general, endemic in-feed advertisements were rated more favorably on source expertise and brand interest, while linked in-feed advertisements scored higher on attitude toward the advertisement. Three-way interaction effects were found for source trustworthiness, attitude toward the advertisement, brand interest, and purchase intention. Endemic in-feed advertisements showed stronger impact for the high-involvement product on a high-reputable website, while linked in-feed advertisements appeared to work better for the low-involvement product on a low-reputable website.

"Newsfeed native advertising on Facebook: young millennials’ knowledge, pet peeves, reactance and ad avoidance ",2019,"This study explores how young millennials understand and respond to newsfeed native advertising on Facebook, rooting our focus on its covert nature of the ad format. Drawing insight from two persuasion-related theories, we conducted focus group interviews and in-depth interviews with Facebook users aged 19–29. The study revealed three major themes regarding their interactions with newsfeed ads: persuasion knowledge, positive and negative experiences and avoidant coping responses. Participants showed a high level of persuasion knowledge of how Facebook newsfeed ads work and ambivalent attitudes toward newsfeed native ads. Despite some benefits, newsfeed native ads presented strong negative responses, which were often accompanied by reactance and ad avoidance. Multiple themes regarding negative experiences emerged: ad intrusiveness, ad clutter, a lack of relevance, too personal, privacy concern, goal impediment and covertness. Participants also voiced less autonomy in controlling their exposure to newsfeed ads. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and a model for future research is provided.

The Effects of Native Ads on Consumer Brand Engagement: The Moderating Role of Website Credibility ,2019,"This research examined the effect of native ads on consumer brand engagement – specifically, how source disclosure of ad sponsors affected consumers’ perceived ad deceptiveness as well as their attitude toward the company and the brand. It also explored the moderating role of website credibility. One hundred and ten college students in South Korea participated in the experimental study, which found that high source disclosure of ad sponsors positively affected perceived deceptiveness. The effect of source disclosure on perceived deceptiveness was moderated by website credibility. Perceived deceptiveness negatively affected consumers’ attitude toward the company and the brand. The mediating role of perceived deceptiveness between source disclosure and consumer brand engagement was confirmed only when website credibility was high.

Consumers’ responses to native vs. banner advertising: moderation of persuasion knowledge on interaction effects of ad type and placement type ,2019,"Applying advertising contextual theory, we examined the conditions under which native advertising embedded in a news website was more effective. With the use of college students (n = 189),  2 (type of ad: native vs. banner) x 2 (type of ad placement: solo vs. duo) x 2 (persuasion knowledge: high vs. low) online experimental design was employed. In the solo condition, native advertising was evaluated more favorably than banner advertising in perceived fit, ad credibility, brand attitudes and click intention. Significant interaction effects between ad type and placement type were found on all dependent variables, with native advertising showing a significant decrease in duo (vs. solo) placement. These interaction effects appeared to be more pronounced for consumers with high persuasion knowledge, confirming its moderating role.

Advertising nativeness as a function of content and design congruence ,2019,"Despite high interest in native advertising, the definition and effectiveness of native advertising remain subjects of debate. To address this problem, we explored the nature of perceived advertising nativeness as experienced by media users, developed a scale to measure this perception, and examined how it influenced advertising outcomes. Using survey data about 32 ad stimuli from three studies, we examined the nature and role of perceived advertising nativeness. The 6-item ad nativeness scale, consisting of two congruence dimensions (i.e. content nativeness and design nativeness), was reliable and valid, and the construct significantly influenced attitude towards the advertisement (Aad), attitude towards the brand (Ab), and purchase intention (PI). Content and design nativeness had different effects on these advertising outcomes at different levels (high vs. low) of consumer involvement. This study contributes to the theoretical knowledge of native advertising and offers an empirical method for optimizing the performance of native advertising.

Ad Disclosure vs. Ad Recognition: How Persuasion Knowledge Influences Native Advertising Evaluation ,2019,"This study investigated how ad disclosure and ad recognition predict the effectiveness of native advertising in relation to persuasion knowledge. Two experimental studies revealed that evaluation of a natively formatted ad was influenced by knowledge of social media advertising tactics and ad recognition, rather than the explicitness of ad disclosure. Findings suggest that recognition of the natively formatted ad was triggered mostly by prior experience with social media ads, rather than ad disclosure. These findings also suggest the limited effects of ad disclosure and signify the importance of consumer education. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Consumer perceptions of digital native advertising and banner advertising ,2019,"This study investigates consumer perceptions of article-style native advertisements and banner advertisements, in terms of understanding the message intent, ad attitudes, and ad credibility. In addition, it examines the interrelationships of these constructs and their effects on the brand. Data retrieved from 303 respondents in an online experiment, analysed with partial least squares path modelling, show that, contrary to prior research, consumers actually evaluate banners more positively than article-style native ads, in terms of attitude and credibility. Banners also show a larger understanding of message intent. Ad attitude, ad credibility, and understanding of message intent significantly mediate the relations between ad type (banners versus article-style native ads) and brand effects. These results provide important insights for brand managers, ad agencies, and publishers that can increase the effectiveness of online advertising planning.

The perceived effectiveness of overt versus covert promotions ,2019,"Purpose – The purpose of this study contributes to literature on marketing communications by empirically contrasting the effectiveness of a new form of covert promotions (product placement in recipes) and an overt promotion (traditional advertisement). The mediating role of perceived believability of promotional materials and the moderating roles of advertising skepticism and brand awareness were examined based on a conceptual model.

Design/methodology/approach – A Web-based experiment with 2 (form of promotion: overt versus covert)  2 (brand awareness: low versus high) between-subjects full factorial design was used. A public sample of 537 participants had participated in the study. The conceptual model was further tested on 106 participants using stimuli of a fictitious brand.

Findings – A two-stage moderated mediation analysis shows that the perceived believability of promotional materials was a significant mediator of the form of promotion and brand evaluations. Consumers showed a higher level of believability toward covert promotion, which, in turn, led to more positive evaluations of the promoted brand. Advertising skepticism and brand awareness were found to significantly moderate the relationship between form of promotion and attitudes toward the promoted brands. A similar pattern of results was obtained when stimuli of a fictitious brand were used.

Originality/value – This research addresses an important issue in marketing communication and extends the understanding of the perception of overt and covert promotions by examining the underlying mediating and moderating variables, which have rarely been explored before. The results guide marketers in developing effective marketing communication strategies for well-known, less well-known and even new brands. It also directs policymakers to consider whether integrated branded content in recipes should be disclosed to protect consumers from surreptitious promotions, which may help to lower consumers’ skepticism toward advertising in the long run.",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,"""effectiveness of NA, develop effective marketing communications strategies"" - PFE

"The Challenges Native Advertising Poses: Exploring Potential Federal Trade Commission Responses
and Identifying Research Needs",2019,"Native advertising is a new form of online advertising that appears in many settings, such as blogs, social media, and entertainment and news publications. Native ads typically blend with their surrounding context, stem from sources or placements that do not signal advertising, lack overtly persuasive or sales-focused messaging, and have less clear material outcomes. Such characteristics raise ethical concerns because native ads are more difficult for consumers to identify and because they challenge concepts that are central to current deceptive advertising policy. Native advertising is a Federal Trade Commission enforcement priority, and the agency has developed guidelines for this new ad form. However, the unique characteristics of native advertising likely require novel approaches to protect consumers. In this article, the authors trace the evolution of regulation relevant to native advertising. They identify shortcomings and propose remedies that the Federal Trade Commission or industry could adopt to prevent consumer harm, detect infractions, and enforce its regulations. The authors also develop an agenda for future research needed to more fully inform public policy and industry response in this arena.

Recognizing Native Ads as Advertising: Attitudinal and Behavioral Consequences ,2019,"This study assessed consumers’ initial reactions to in-feed native ads appearing as news content. In particular, it focuses on consumers’ recognition of advertising when they realize that content they had thought were news stories had in fact been advertising. Recognition of advertising made consumers infer that advertisers had deliberately manipulated them. Consequently, consumers engaged less with the message, had less positive attitudes toward the brand, and were less likely to purchase and share. The results demonstrated the mechanisms through which the two mediators, manipulative intent and message engagement, lowered brand attitude, purchase intention, and sharing intention. In addition, ad disclosure made more people recognize the ad when they were exposed to it than when it was not disclosed as an ad. ",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,"""Recognition of adveretising"" - PCD

Measuring Sponsorship Transparency in the Age of Native Advertising ,2018,"As advertisers continue to develop new formats of online content that blurs the line between advertising and news or entertainment, the need to understand how consumers process covert advertising grows. While regulators and industry practitioners agree that transparency is paramount to preventing consumer deception, there exists no established way of determining the extent to which a given message transparently conveys to consumers that is a paid advertisement. The current study makes the case for, develops, and validates a scale to measure sponsorship transparency.

Seeing Native Advertising Production via the Business Model Lens: The Case of Forbes’s BrandVoice Unit ,2018,"Although the production side of advertising has interested scholars for decades, research has focused primarily on isolated agency practices and interactions with clients. Discussion has been limited regarding how an ad agency coordinates and connects multiple activities and relationships, and how the agency setup has evolved over time. This question has become particularly interesting in the age of digitization, in which new forms of advertising require new ways of organizing production. In a case study of Forbes’s BrandVoice unit, this article specifically examines native advertising production via the business model lens, illustrating how BrandVoice consciously borrows production logics from journalism and distribution practices of platform economies.

The Role of a Companion Banner and Sponsorship Transparency in Recognizing and Evaluating Article-style Native Advertising ,2018,"Native advertising is a relatively new form of online advertising that matches the format of surrounding non-advertising content. The fact that native advertising blends into its context risks deceiving consumers who may be unaware the content they are viewing is actually advertising. Article-style native advertising, a native ad form that mimics the style of online news articles, is particularly concerning since consumers may not expect advertising to appear in such a format. Such concern is supported by research finding low efficacy of traditional disclosures on article-style native advertisements. We investigate a novel means of increasing ad recognition through the use of companion banner advertising. Across two experiments we demonstrate that inclusion of a companion banner boosts consumer recognition of the paid nature of article-style native advertising to the same degree as a traditional disclosure. In both cases we also find that the negative reactions caused by ad recognition are muted when a native ad is perceived as having higher sponsorship transparency. These effects occur for both familiar and unfamiliar brands. Taken together, results not only detail the efficacy of a new means of achieving adequate disclosure, but also develop greater understanding of how consumers respond to article-style native advertising.",0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,"""deceiving consumers"" - PFV

Building a Better Native Advertising Disclosure ,2017,"Past research has shown that consumers’ ability to identify sponsored news articles as advertising is low. This study utilized two experiments to identify characteristics of native advertising disclosures that can lead to higher levels of recognition. An online experiment (N = 242) showed that higher levels of visual prominence in the form of size and color contrast increased advertising recognition, and that language explicitness increased recognition when visual prominence was high. An eye-tracking lab experiment (N = 90) showed that such high-visual-prominence, high-explicitness disclosures are more likely to be noticed and more likely to lead to advertising recognition when they are embedded within the story text than when they are at the absolute or relative top of the page.",0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,"""ability to identify news articles as advertising.""

Understanding “Native Advertising” from the Perspective of Communication Strategies ,2017,"Native advertising is at the intersection of strategic communication and journalism information. As a type of commercial hybrid content, its distinctiveness as a promotional method is questioned. As a vehicle for informing, it blends in with the surrounding editorial causes concern. Thus, the purpose of this study is to deconstruct “native advertising” and form a clearer understanding of this emerging and changing concept. To serve this purpose, this study conducted content analysis of communication strategies of 151 native advertisements sampled from three news websites. The findings revealed that more than half of the sample cited sources and disclosed sponsors. Congruence was largely based upon function-based associations. About one-third of the native advertisements offered how-to advice and addressed connections between the sponsor and the story. Sometimes, the sponsor was not mentioned in the stories at all. The findings suggest that native advertising exhibits certain features of sponsored content, differs from traditional advertising or advertorials, and imitates journalistic style and format. This study also recommends that strategic persuasion goals should be balanced against congruence with the style and the format of the surrounding journalism.",0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,"""sample of native advertisments sampled from 3 news website"" - pp1

Going Native on Social Media: The Effects of Social Media Characteristics on Native Ad Effectiveness ,2017,"An online survey (N = 320) was conducted to examine the effects of social media characteristics on native ad effectiveness. Results show perceived intimacy, professionalism, and anonymity positively predict consumers’ attitude toward native advertising, trust toward the ad sponsor, and satisfaction toward the sponsor. Further, the findings also show network size is a significant positive predictor for trust toward the ad sponsor, with theoretical and practical implications discussed.",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,,,

To Disguise or to Disclose? The Influence of Disclosure Recognition and Brand Presence on Readers' Responses Toward Native Advertisements in Online News Media ,2017,"While several studies have focused on native advertisements’ disclosures, little research has been conducted on native advertisements’ content. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of both disclosure recognition and brand presence on readers’ persuasion knowledge (PK) and subsequent evaluations. Results of an online study (N = 290) showed that disclosure recognition resulted in higher conceptual PK, yet this had no effect on readers’ attitudinal PK and evaluations. Conversely, high brand presence did not increase readers’ conceptual PK, but it did increase attitudinal PK, which subsequently decreased evaluations of the ad, brand, and news medium. Implications are discussed.",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,

Product Type and Spokespersons in Native Advertising – The Role of Congruency and Acceptance ,2017,"This study explored how product type and featured spokesperson affected (a) perceived congruence between a native ad and a social media platform and (b) level of acceptance of the native ad and, in turn, how congruence and acceptance influenced advertising outcomes. The findings revealed that congruence and acceptance positively influence attitude toward the ad, attitude toward the brand, purchase intention, and intention to engage in social media activity. Furthermore, the results showed that the native ad for a self-expressive product that featured a layperson generated the highest levels of congruency. This study also found that perceived congruence between product type and spokesperson moderated the effect of product type on advertising acceptance.",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,,,

"Now You See Me, But You Don't Know: Consumer Processing of Native Advertisements in Online News Sites ",2017,"Native advertising has become a growing trend in news outlets to break through the clutter of advertisements to reach consumers. This exploratory study investigates consumers’ cognitive processing of native advertisements in U.S. online news sites. Using think aloud techniques, 30 interviews revealed that two-thirds of participants saw native ads in the provided online news sites, but less than half of them were aware of the persuasive intent of the native ads. For those who recognized native advertisements in the news sites, brand elements, and ad disclosures were the most commonly reported identifiers. Furthermore, native advertising does not always generate negative perceptions. Practical and policy implications and future research directions are discussed. ",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,

"Transparency for Sponsored Content: Analysing Codes of Ethics in Public Relations, Marketing, Advertising and Journalism ",2017,"As sponsored content is gaining ground globally, the boundaries between strategic communication, advertising and journalism are blurring. As sponsored content becomes more common, it raises novel ethical concerns that no industry alone can answer, such as How much disclosure is needed for transparency? Self-regulation via codes of ethics has been suggested as a remedy to meet the rising transparency expectations, and this article analysed 40 codes of ethics in the fields of communication, advertising, and journalism (United States and Finland) related to sponsored content. The results indicate that there remains excessive variation within the codes of ethics of how transparency of sponsored content is addressed. According to our analysis, most of the codes deal with transparency and the separation between commercial and editorial content only vaguely, and only eight of the total 40 guidelines take sponsored content into account. Therefore, we believe that the strategic benefit of sponsored content is threatened as long as no joint codes of ethics exist for sponsored content. To the degree that sponsored content is practiced across professions, we call for a joint code of ethics for sponsored content transparency, as the current codes of ethics fail to answer this emerging need.",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,,,

Editorial Content In Native Advertising: How Do Brand Placement and Content Quality Affect Native Advertising Effectiveness?,2017,"This study examines how brand placement in editorial content (i.e., whether a sponsoring brand is mentioned in editorial content) affects consumers’ responses to native advertising and whether the effect is moderated by either high or low quality of editorial content. Results of an experiment showed significant interaction effects between brand placement and content quality. Brand placement had negative effects on source credibility and message attitudes only when the quality of editorial content was low, not when the quality was high.",0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,,,

Digital Native Advertising: Practitioner Perspectives and a Research Agenda ,2017,"Digital native advertising is a subtle form of digital advertising that is integrated closely with its context. Practitioners are increasingly assigning budgets to this advertising strategy. On the basis of 22 in-depth expert interviews with senior executives of advertising brands, publishing companies, and media agencies, this study provides new insights into the effectiveness of digital native advertising. We also shed light on factors in the field of content and context of digital native advertising that influence its performance. We present 10 key propositions that reflect practitioners’ perspectives and form an agenda for further scientific research in the field of digital native advertising. ",0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,,,

"Disclosing Instagram Influencer Advertising: The Effects of Disclosure Language on Advertising Recognition, Attitudes, and Behavioral Intent ",2017,"In this study we examined the effect of disclosure language (control/no disclosure, “SP,” “Sponsored,” and “Paid Ad”) in Instagram-based influencer advertising on ad recognition, brand attitude, purchase intention, and sharing intention among a sample of 237 students. In line with prior research, results indicated that disclosure language featuring “Paid Ad” positively influenced ad recognition, which subsequently interacted with participants’ memory of a disclosure and mediated the effect of disclosure language on attitude toward the brand and sharing intention. The findings offer a significant contribution to the literature on consumers’ information processing and understanding for new and developing native advertising executions.

Going Native: Effects of Disclosure Position and Language on the Recognition and Evaluation of Online Native Advertising ,2016,"Despite recent industry attention, questions remain about how native advertising is perceived and processed by consumers. Two experiments examined effects of language and positioning in native advertising disclosures on recognition of the content as advertising, effects of recognition on brand and publisher evaluations, and whether disclosure position affects visual attention. Findings show that middle or bottom positioning and wording using “advertising” or “sponsored” increased advertising recognition compared to other conditions, and ad recognition generally led to more negative evaluations. Visual attention mediated the relationship between disclosure position and advertising recognition. Theoretical, practical, and regulatory implications for disclosures in native advertising are discussed. ",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,

"Consumer Perceptions of Credibility and Selling Intent Among Advertisements, Advertorials, and Editorials: A Persuasion Knowledge Model Approach ",2015,"This article presents the results of a study of consumer reaction to three different types of information delivery in magazines: editorials, advertorials, and advertisements. The study draws on the Persuasion Knowledge Model to examine the effect of each form of information delivery on source influence, source credibility, perceived selling intent and purchase intention. The analysis indicates that the form of information delivery in print media affects the perceived credibility of the source of the information, the perceived selling intention and the purchase intention. Implications for marketers and policy-makers are also discussed. ",0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,,,

When is Advertising Advertising? Comparing Responses to Non-Traditional and Traditional Advertising Media ,2012,"This paper investigates how consumers identify advertising. Research on new advertising formats such as advertorials etc. shows that they may be more effective than traditional advertising formats. While building on the underlying assumption that the new advertising formats blur the boundaries between advertising and its surrounding content, this has never been tested directly. We draw upon representation and categorization theory to hypothesize that a new advertising format, such as placing an ad message in a non-traditional advertising medium (which has never previously featured advertising), makes it more difficult to identify the message as advertising. As a result, consumers should activate their advertising schemas to a lesser extent and evaluate the message more favorably. An experiment, in which the ad message was placed in either a traditional or non-traditional medium, confirmed the hypotheses.",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,,,

Advertiser Pressure and the Personal Ethical norms of newspaper Editors and Ad Directors ,2011,"Newspaper journalists and advertising directors were surveyed to update and extend research on advertising pressure. Results reveal that:

- advertiser pressure is widespread in newspapers; despite economic threats, however, advertisers succeed with their influence attempts relatively infrequently;
- smaller newspapers do not differ much from larger ones with regard to any forms of advertiser pressure;
- advertising directors are more permissive in their personal ethical norms for handling advertiser pressure than editors;
- employees of small newspapers are not much more permissive in their ethical norms than those of large papers; 
- the amount of economic pressure a newspaper received (but not other forms of pressure such as influence attempts and acquiescence) is positively correlated with the permissiveness of media workers’ personal ethical norms.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,

"""Being Hooked"" By Editorial Content: The Implications for Processing Narrative Advertising ",2009,"Processing narratives demands sufficient cognitive resources; therefore, the effectiveness of narrative advertising depends on individuals’ cognitive capacities. In contexts where cognitive capacity was constrained by processing narrative editorials, narrative advertising was less likely to transport and “hook” readers or evoke empathy. The relative effectiveness of narrative and argument advertising was also moderated by editorial content. When reading narrative magazine articles, participants failed to take argument strength into account when evaluating a subsequent ad. In addition, the superior effectiveness of narrative advertising compared to argument advertising in terms of generating more favorable cognitive responses, warm feelings, and positive ad and brand attitudes did not emerge when participants read narrative articles. In contrast, when reading facts-based articles, participants elaborated more on the subsequent ad and took argument strength into account. In this condition, narrative advertising was able to be processed and, as a result, was more effective than argument advertising",0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,,,

A survey of 219 advertising directors at U.S. daily newspapers showed frequent conflicts between the business side and the journalism side of the newspaper operation. Those at small newspapers or chain-owned newspapers were more likely to endorse scenarios where editorial integrity was compromised to please or refrain from offending their advertisers.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,,,

Branded Entertainment: A New Advertising Technique or Product Placement in Disguise? ,2006,"In the last few decades product placement has matured and become more sophisticated. Branded products are no longer just ‘placed’; they are woven into entertainment content making a stronger emotional connection with the consumer. The outcome is a concept the advertising industry is calling branded entertainment, a convergence of advertising and entertainment. This article considers whether or not branded entertainment is a new technique, or just another form of product placement. By tracking the evolution of product placement and from an analysis of the two concepts, it is suggested that branded entertainment is a new term to describe a more contemporary, sophisticated use of product placement. A conceptual framework for understanding the various forms of product placement is presented, and this highlights the key influences on the effectiveness of this fast-growing marketing phenomenon. The important management issues related to product placement are considered; issues related to measurement, control, and ethics. The article then concludes with recommendations for further research.",0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,,,

Readers' Reactions to Mixtures of Advertising and Editorial Content in Magazines ,2005,"This article focuses on reactions toward two mixtures of advertising and editorial content in magazines, namely theme features and advertorials. A survey among subscribers (N = 316) to five diferent magazines showed that the most editorial mixture generated the most attention, appreciation, and acceptance. Furthermore, audience reactions toward mixtures were influenced by the perceived authority and informational value of the magazines. The findings did not substantiate concerns that have been expressed in the literature about the misleading character of these subtle forms of advertising.

Reevaluating Public Relations Information Subsidies: Market-Driven Journalism and Agenda-Building Theory and Practice ,1999,"Public relations practitioners provide information subsidies to the media on behalf of their clients to influence the media agenda and potentially affect public opinion. McManus (1994) stated that news media are using more public relations information subsidies to contain costs and increase profits. Through in-depth interviews and a nationwide survey, this study of editors' perceptions of the phenomenon suggests that increasing economic constraints have led to an increased use of public relations materials only in specific instances that often do not support the agenda-building goals of the sponsoring organizations.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,

Reader Categorization of a Controversial Communication: Advertisement Versus Editorial,1995,"Using a disguised, structured technique, the authors collected consumer judgments regarding an editorial advertisement entitled ""Of cigarettes and science"" sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Respondents were shown an actual newspaper section that contained different types of editorials and advertisements, including the ""Of cigarettes and science"" item. After the respondents indirectly classified each item as either an editorial or advertisement, they were asked to list at least two characteristics about the appearance or wording of the ""Of cigarettes and science"" item that caused them to classify it as they did. The majority of respondents thought the item was an advertisement because it looked different
from editorial items, was sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and seemed to have a persuasive or promotional content. Over one-fourth of the respondents, however; identified the communication as an editorial because of its lack of direct sales information and its extensive wording.

Newspaper Policies on the Potential Merging of Advertising and News Content ,1994,"Newspaper readers more readily trust news than advertising content. Therefore, journalists and media scholars consider it important that audiences can distinguish between news stories and advertisements. The authors collected survey responses from 321 daily newspapers on their standards for acceptable advertising for publication. The responses were analyzed to discover if advertising acceptance policies and practices reflect publications' willingness to blur the lines between news and advertising sections. The data indicate that most newspapers are careful about letting advertisers pretend their messages are really news stories. In general, newspapers' journalistic priorities for honesty influence their advertising policies. A few newspapers may use the editorial content to help sell advertising space and otherwise blur the lines between news and advertising content, but it is not a common and widespread problem.",0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,,,

The two empirical studies that examined advertising pressures on editors and writers at farm, business, and consumer magazines found that the pressure is much greater than suggested by academic writers. Another study of television found organizational pressures to approve deceptive program-length advertisements, i.e., infomercials. This study extended the empirical research about advertising pressures to newspapers. A survey of editors at daily newspapers found that just under ninety percent reported that advertisers attempted to influence the content of stories appearing in their papers; ninety percent had economic pressure applied on them by advertisers because of their reporting; and thirty-seven percent had capitulated to advertiser pressure.
